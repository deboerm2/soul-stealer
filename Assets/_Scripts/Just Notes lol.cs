    //POSSESSION
    //build up from?
    //1. attacking
    //2. killing
    //either a resource on the enemy (like a stance break)
    //or a resource the player has to be spent
    //if player resource could lose some when hit, could be a shield? then spend the shield to possess a body, keeping the "shield"

    //REASON TO POSSESS
    //base player does low damage with a dodge, can complete level without possessing but will be hard/slow
    //enemies will not have many/any forms of survivability, supposessed to be expendable. Possessions will do much better damage (even the grunts).
