    //PLAYER GOAL / GAMEPLAY LOOP
    //Level based, level select / complete one to move on
    //Think pizzakai, connected rooms/hallways going mostly forward. Can bypass some rooms by choosing others.
    //end of level = boss

    //POSSESSION
    //a resource the player has to be spent. loses some when taking damage?
    //build up from?
    //1. attacking: high risk move for player
    //2. killing: main way of gaining energy
    //inherit enemy's current HP as a "vitality mantle", when hp goes to zero, possessed dies and possession ends.

    //REASON TO POSSESS
    //base player does low damage with a dodge, can complete level without possessing but will be hard/slow
    //enemies will not have many/any forms of survivability, supposessed to be expendable. Possessions will do much better damage (even the grunts).
    //Can still gain soul energy in a possession, create positive feedback loop. kill -> gain energy -> possess -> more kills -> more energy.

    //BASE PLAYER
    //low damage
    //high risk high reward soul sucking move, gains soul/possession energy w/o needing to kill for it. Hollow Knight Dream Nail vibes.
    //

    //ENEMIES
    //Basic: standard zombie type enemy
    //Giant: a mini-boss / high priority possession. maybe throws a rock or something?
    //Jumper: applies more pressure than basic enemy / a more lethal version of basic
    //Flyer: a harrasser, meant to debuff player to make enemies more lethal. Most likely a slowing projectile, but could also cause player displacement/knockback.
    //         has an "anchor" that needs to be found and attacked/possessed to deal with flyer.
    //         minecraft creaking + creaking heart dynamic.

    //LEVELS/ARENAS
    //mostly simple and open.
    //think BPM(bullets per minute) style rooms

    //BOSSES 
    // Each boss would have a specific object/enemy that needs to be possessed to damage boss. 
    //build up energy and avoid boss to possess unique enemy.
    //unique eenmy will have a high energy cost to possess (probably 80%-100% soul meter)

    //UNIQUE ENEMY IDEAS
    //1. Just does special damage
    //2. has unique size / mobility to allow for player access to damage phase. (ex. smaller hitbox to get through small hole)
    //3.
