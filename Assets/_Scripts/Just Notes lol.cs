    //POSSESSION
    //build up from?
    //1. attacking
    //2. killing
    //a resource the player has to be spent
    //if player resource could lose some when hit, could be a shield?

    //REASON TO POSSESS
    //base player does low damage with a dodge, can complete level without possessing but will be hard/slow
    //enemies will not have many/any forms of survivability, supposessed to be expendable. Possessions will do much better damage (even the grunts).

    //BASE PLAYER

    //ENEMIES
    //Basic: standard zombie type enemy
    //Giant: a mini-boss / high priority possession. maybe throws a rock or something?
    //Jumper: applies more pressure than basic enemy / a more lethal version of basic
    //Flyer: a harrasser, meant to debuff player to make enemies more lethal.
    //         has an "anchor" that needs to be found and attacked/possessed to deal with flyer.
    //         minecraft creaking + creaking heart dynamic.
